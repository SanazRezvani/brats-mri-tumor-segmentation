# Brain Tumor MRI Segmentation with MATLAB (BraTS)

A MATLAB-based medical image segmentation pipeline using the BraTS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) dataset.

This project demonstrates a complete medical imaging workflow for brain MRI analysis, including:

- Loading multi-modal NIfTI MRI volumes
- MRI preprocessing and normalisation
- Tumor mask exploration and visualisation
- 2D slice dataset construction
- U-Net-based semantic segmentation
- Quantitative evaluation using Dice and IoU metrics

The repository is designed as a research-engineering prototype for medical image analysis and biomedical AI workflows.

# Project Overview

Brain tumor segmentation is an important task in medical image analysis, enabling quantitative assessment of tumor regions from MRI scans.

This project uses the BraTS dataset and focuses on:

- FLAIR MRI preprocessing
- Whole tumor segmentation
- 2D U-Net training in MATLAB
- Patient-wise train/validation/test splitting
- Quantitative performance evaluation

The workflow is intentionally modular and reproducible, making it suitable for experimentation, extension, and educational purposes.
